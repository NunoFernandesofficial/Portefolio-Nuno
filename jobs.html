                <a> Cinemas NOS (July 2022 - Present)</a>
                <p>As a sales representative, I had the opportunity to improve important skills in managing
                    relationships with customers, as well as ensuring the cleanliness and hygiene of the
                    rooms and the replenishment of stock. This allowed me to develop important skills in
                    task management and providing exceptional customer service.</p>

                <a>STL Co-Captain (Jannuary 2022 - Present)</a>
                <p>Capture The Flag competitions are cybersecurity-based events where participants
                    compete against each other with the goal of finding as many flags as possible by solving
                    exercises that will increase their score and move up in the event's ranking.
                    In this position I gained team leadership skills, team work and some ethical hacking skills.

                <a>Telecommunications Thecnician (Jannuary 2020 - August 2021)</a>
                <p>This work allowed me to independently develop basic skills in building coaxial and
                    Ethernet networks. This reinforced my understanding of the network infrastructure and
                    allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge in a practical manner</p>
